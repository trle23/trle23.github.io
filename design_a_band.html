    <h2>Band Biography</h2>
    <p>
      After Ever After was formed in Austin, Texas by two best friends: Olivia Montes and Jack McCollins. Olivia and Jack formed After Ever After on May 23 of 2013. They were on their way to grab some pizza after school. They passed by an alley and heard music playing. They decided that they would go down the alley to check out the music. It turned out to be a few teenagers around 15 years of age messing around with the cans and bins, making some music with it. They were inspired by those teenagers, so they decided to make music too. After Ever After’s first album was inspired by those teenagers.

    <p>
      Self-hatred was made when they were both going through a phase.
